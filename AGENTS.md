## profile.json

The `src/profile.json` file is automatically generated by the `career-toolkit` project from data in the `my-career-data` repository.

**DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.**

If you need to make changes to the profile data, you should either:

1.  Modify the source YAML files in `my-career-data/data/`.
2.  Adjust the export logic in `career-toolkit/src/career_toolkit/engines/json_profile.py`.

After making changes, regenerate the `profile.json` file by running the export command from the `career-toolkit` directory.
